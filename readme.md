# Tiled2Unity

Tiled2Unity is made up of two parts:
- The [utility](tool/Tiled2Unity) that exports TMX files into Unity.
- The [Unity scripts](unity/Tiled2Unity) that import the output of the Tiled2Unity Utility.

See documenation on the [Tiled2Unity ReadTheDocs page](http://tiled2unity.readthedocs.io).
